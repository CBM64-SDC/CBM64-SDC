YOLO V2 using the yolo's darknet implementation found here: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
This is just a tiny implementation using their built API and weights, where you can find the implementation in the implementation.ipynb file, along with the model implemented in keras using tensorflow as the backend. :)
